# tango_romeo

    tl;dr: `tango_romeo` is an implementation of tech radar.

With the ever changing landscape of software development technologies, any tech team has to always be on the hunt for improving and adopting the best and latest pieces of libraries and frameworks. To keep track of this pursuit of the best tech stack "tech radars" have been used. `tango_romeo` is my implementation of this with Go.

## Features

    Note: features are still being explored, feel free to suggest your idea through the issues!

## What's with the name?
"Tango Romeo" is NATO spelling for TR, which in turn means Tech Radar. I Honestly I couldn't find a good name for the project ðŸ˜… As the old adage goes, if there are two hard things in Computer Science, they are writing git commit messages and naming things.

This is partly my toy project, partly an attempt at making something that my team can use at work.
